                <p>My strengths up until the last 6 years 
                have mainly been that I was an incredibly
                 sociable and caring person, which lead me to work as a faciltator 
                 for young adult with learning difficulties. Having dropped out 
                 of university and without a degree, I also did not see what else
                 I could do. My life drastically changed after moving abroad,
                 becoming a mother and learning French.<br></p>
                 <p>This experience brought out strengths I never knew I had.
                 I didn't know how resourceful, creative and how didicated I could be
                to learn new things.</p>
